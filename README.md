# Karens-Wall
A simple HTML file with internal jscript and css to post message in a thread. I named it Karen's Wall for some reason...I don't know why.
I was quite bored and wanted to refresh my html and check if it was still in me to write it from scratch.


No stress and importance has been given to the UI of the webpage. One can easily edit certain stylesheet parameters in the document according to their needs. head section contains internal javascript and stylesheet blocks. A bit of UX has been considered and I have added the functionality to make the message box invisible.

On page refresh, the thread will be gone because the content of html elements on script insertion are not persistent.

## Things I can and maybe will add
* timestamp of message
* delay on posting a message
* make the thread content persistent in localstorage.
* Will try to make thread content persistent by adding the "server request" functionality and use files to store data.(so far-fetched that I might run away)

## Far-fetched sh*t one can do from this simple thread
* Encrypt the data
* turn this into a website with login and registration functionalities
* Server-client request file-handling to store data on server
* Turn this crappy basic thing into a classic social forum

## Far-far-far-far-far-far-far-far-far-far-fetched 
* Reddit
* Facebook
* Disqus
